Examining the keywords in email subject lines might help you identify popular discussion topics.

Determines how much communication is internal (emails between employees) compared to external (emails between employees and contacts outside the company).

Improvement Journal
The process of creating the code used in the Business Report is shown in the Development Notebook. It contains:

installing and importing the required libraries.
accessing the database schema and comprehending it.
to extract data from the database, write SQL queries.
using pandas to load query results into dataframes for manipulation.
preparing and cleaning data.
tasks involving the filtering, grouping, and aggregation of data.
Debugging and testing the code.
code refactoring and optimization for improved readability and efficiency.
More technical information, including more thorough descriptions of the code, pseudocode, code testing, and industry best practices, can be found in the development notebook.
